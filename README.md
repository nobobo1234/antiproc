To install this extension you:

2. Navigate to ``chrome://extension`` in your chrome webbrowser
3. Open your file explorer and navigate to the root folder of the just-cloned git folder
4. Drag the src.crx into the ``chrome://extension`` page and accept the permissions.
5. Now click on the icon that appeared in your taskbar and have fun!
