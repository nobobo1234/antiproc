# AntiProc

This extension helps you stop procrasinating. It allows you to:
1. Block certain sites
2. Set times to block these sites

## Building...

The recommended node version is the latest one, in my case it's `10.15.3`, then also use the latest npm and yarn versions. For yarn I used `1.12.3` and for npm I used `6.4.1`. You can pratically build this on any operating system, just don't use too old ones.

### Building steps
1. Clone the git repository
2. `cd` in the just downloaded folder
3. Use yarn or npm to install the packages: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Then run `yarn run build` or `npm run build` to build the extension.
